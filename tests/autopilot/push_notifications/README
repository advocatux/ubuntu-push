To run ubuntu-push autopilot tests you need to have a push server available. This can be running locally using loopback (127.0.0.1) or remotely on the same network.

----------------------------------
To configure and build the server:
----------------------------------

1) export GOPATH=${PWD}/push
2) mkdir -p push/src/launchpad.net
3) cd push/src/launchpad.net
4) bzr branch lp:ubuntu-push
5) Edit ubuntu-push/sampleconfigs/dev.json:
    "addr": "192.168.1.2:9090",
5) cd ubuntu-push
6) make bootstrap
7) make run-server-dev
   Following output should be observed:
     INFO listening for http on 192.168.1.2:8080
     INFO listening for devices on 192.168.1.2:9090

------------------------
To configure the client:
------------------------

1) bzr branch lp:ubuntu-push
2) Edit ip address and ports to match environment: ubuntu-push/tests/autopilot/push_notifications/config/push.conf:
    [config]
    addr = 192.168.1.2
    listener_port = 8080
    device_port = 9090
    cert_pem_file = testing.cert
3) cd ubuntu-push/tests/autopilot
4) autopilot3 list push_notifications
5) autopilot3 run push_notifications

----------------
Troubleshooting:
----------------

1) Ping from client to server to ensure connectivity is correct
2) Delete ~/.local/share/ubuntu-push-client/levels.db if no notifications are being displayed:
    rm ~/.local/share-ubuntu-push-client/levels.db
3) Check client log file at ~/.cache/upstart/ubuntu-push-client.log:
    tail -f --line=30 ~/.cache/upstart/ubuntu-push-client.log
4) To send a notification manually:
     echo '{"channel":"system", "data": {"ubuntu-touch/trusty-proposed/mako": [297, ""]}, "expire_on": "2015-12-19T16:39:57-08:00"}' | POST -c application/json http://192.168.1.2:8080/broadcast
   Response should be:
     {"ok":true}
   Note that:
     - The channel and device names must match the client.
     - The build number must be greater than current installed version in order to trigger an update message.
     - The expiration time must be in the future.
5) Make sure unity8-autopilot is installed
