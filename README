Ubuntu Push Notifications
-------------------------

Protocol, client, and development code for Ubuntu Push Notifications.

The code expects to be checked out as launchpad.net/ubuntu-push in a Go
workspace, see "go help gopath".

To setup Go dependencies, install the following libraries:

               libsqlite3-dev
               qtbase5-private-dev
               qtdeclarative5-dev
               libqt5opengl5-dev
               libubuntuoneauth-2.0-dev

and run:

   make bootstrap

To run tests, install libgcrypt11-dev, libwhoopsie-dev, and
libubuntuoneauth-2.0-dev and run:

   make check

To produce coverage reports you need Go 1.2 (default on Trusty) and
the cover tool (in the golang-go.tools package),
then run:

   make coverage-summary

for a summary report, or:

for per-package HTML with annotated code in coverhtml/<package-name>.html

  make coverage-html

(it makes also textual coverhtml/<package-name>.txt reports).

To run the acceptance tests, change to the acceptance subdir and run:

  make acceptance

There are build targets to build the client:

  make build-client

building ubuntu-push-client, and to run the development server:

  make run-server-dev
