Ubuntu Push Notifications
--------------------------

Protocol, client, and development code for Ubuntu Push Notifications.

The code expects to be checked out as launchpad.net/ubuntu-push in a Go
workspace, see go help gopath.

To setup go dependencies one can use:

   make bootstrap

To run tests:

   make check

To produce coverage reports go 1.2 (default on trusty) is needed and
the cover tool (the latter can be obtained atm with something like:
sudo GOPATH=<go-workspace> go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/cover
)

then run:

   make coverage-summary

for a summary report, or:

for per package html with annotated code in coverhtml/<package-name>.html

  make coverage-html

(it makes also textual coverhtml/<package-name>.txt reports).

To run the acceptance tests, go into the acceptance subdir and run:

   ./acceptance.sh
