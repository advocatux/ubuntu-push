Ubuntu Push Notifications
-------------------------

Protocol, client, and development code for Ubuntu Push Notifications.

The code expects to be checked out as launchpad.net/ubuntu-push in a Go
workspace, see "go help gopath".

To setup Go dependencies, install libsqlite3-dev and run:

   make bootstrap

To run tests, install libgcrypt11-dev and libwhoopsie-dev and run:

   make check

To produce coverage reports you need Go 1.2 (default on Trusty) and
the cover tool (in the golang-go.tools package),
then run:

   make coverage-summary

for a summary report, or:

for per-package HTML with annotated code in coverhtml/<package-name>.html

  make coverage-html

(it makes also textual coverhtml/<package-name>.txt reports).

To run the acceptance tests, change to the acceptance subdir and run:

  make acceptance

There are build targets to build the client:

  make build-client

building ubuntu-push-client, and the development server:

  make build-server-dev

building push-server-dev.
